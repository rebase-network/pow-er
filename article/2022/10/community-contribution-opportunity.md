## Tl;dr

- A Community Contribution Opportunity (CCO) is a new mechanism for capital coordination that increases the amount of capital available to fund projects by strengthening protections and lowering risks for capital contributors.

- A CCO uses DAO tooling to orchestrate capital contributions to projects in a non-custodial fashion. Capital contributors maintain custody over their capital and have governance power over how it is spent, embedding them as active participants in the project's community and protecting them from risks without the need for trusted relationships.

- These reduced risks make contributing capital significantly more attractive, making more capital available to fund projects, especially for decentralized communities and DAOs looking to amplify the positive impact they can have on the world.

- Decentralized communities and DAOs can conduct a CCO today using the DAOhaus platform.


- 社区贡献机会（CCO）是一种新的资本协调机制，通过加强对投资方的保护并降低投资方的风险，增加可用于项目投资的资金数额。

- CCO 使用 DAO 工具，以非监管的方式协调对项目的资本贡献。投资方保持对其资本的监督，并对如何使用资本拥有治理权，使他们成为项目社区的积极参与者，并在不需要信任关系的情况下保护他们免受风险。

- 这些风险的降低，大大提高了出资的吸引力，使得更多的资金用于项目投资，特别是对于那些希望在全球范围内扩大积极影响力的去中心化社区和 DAO。

- 现在，去中心化的社区和 DAO 可以使用 DAOhaus 平台进行 CCO。

## Current problems in capital coordination
## 当前资本协调机制存在的问题

Capital coordination is an incredibly powerful concept that has driven many of the advances in human well-being. But it has yet to reach its true potential.

If humanity were able to better coordinate capital, we could fund many more valuable projects to further advance aggregate human well-being and help alleviate the unjust distribution of that well-being.

What's stopping that from happening? There are two big, compounding problems. Current capital coordination mechanisms create **information asymmetries** and require capital contributors to **trust project teams with little recourse**. Together, these issues exacerbate the inherent risk of any venture and further limit the amount of capital that would-be contributors are willing to make available to fund projects.

The amount of capital available to fund valuable new projects is inherently limited by the risk of contributing capital to those projects. The higher the perceived risk of losing capital with little to no return, the less interested people are in contributing capital to a project.

Downside risk can be offset by the perception of a high likelihood of a positive return (or even a low likelihood of a large return), but the effect is not symmetric: the wealthy are able to accept the high risk of loss in exchange for the chance of outsized returns much easier than the less wealthy, who may not have that luxury. This structural inevitability [exacerbates wealth inequality](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/how-much-does-venture-capital-drive-us-economy) and promotes unjust outcomes.


资本协调机制是一个无比强大的概念，它推动了人类福祉进步。但目前，它尚未发挥出真正的潜力。

如果人类能够更好地调配资本，我们便可以投资更多有价值的项目，进一步推进人类福祉发展，并帮助缓解这种福祉的不公平分配。

是什么阻碍了我们的步伐呢？主要有两个复杂的大问题。目前的资本协调机制造成了**信息不对称**，并要求出资人**信任缺乏资源的项目团队**。这些问题加剧了企业投资的固有风险，并进一步限制了潜在投资方为项目提供的资金量。

可用于投资有价值的新项目的资金数量，本质上会因为投资方的风险而受到限制。在几乎没有回报率的情况下，人们对于资金亏损的感知风险越高，就越不愿意为一个项目提供资金。

下行风险可以被大概率的正回报 (甚至是低概率的大回报) 这一认知所抵消，但这种影响是不对称的：相比较不太富有的人，富人更容易接受高风险的损失，以换取超额收益的机会；对不太富有的人来说，这种机会非常奢侈。这不可避免的[加剧了贫富差距](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/how-much-does-venture-capital-drive-us-economy)，助长了不公正的结果。

## Information Asymmetry
## 信息不对称

A key factor influencing a person's perception of risk is information. The more information you have about the project and related factors, the better you can assess each. But access to information is not equal; project teams know a lot more about what's going on with their project than anybody else, which multiplies the risk perceived by would-be capital contributors.

If left unchecked, information asymmetry can result in fraud and theft. To combat it, current laws and regulations impose significant constraints and responsibilities on both project teams and prospective capital contributors.

In order to raise capital from the general public, project teams must register their securities and/or make long, complicated, and expensive regulatory filings to receive approval from regulators (subject to only certain exemptions) and are often required to report regular updates to regulators and capital contributors.

Capital contributors are often restricted from participating altogether based on an arbitrary threshold of personal wealth. This is (ostensibly) meant as a form of protection for capital contributors to ensure they are knowledgeable and can sustain a "total loss" of the capital they contribute. In reality, it primarily serves to exacerbate wealth inequality and, counterproductively, reduce the total amount of capital available for projects to do good things in the world.

影响个人对风险感知的一个关键因素就是信息。对项目和相关因素的了解越多，你就可以更好地评估每个因素。但获取信息的机会并不平等；项目团队比其他人更了解项目的情况，这使得潜在投资者认为的风险成倍增加。

如果不加以控制，信息不对称可能导致欺诈和盗窃。为了解决这个问题，现行的法律法规对项目团队和潜在投资者都施加了重大的限制和责任。

为了向公众筹集资金，项目团队必须在证券市场进行注册，或进行冗长、复杂且昂贵的监管申报，以获取监管机构的批准（特定豁免除外），并且通常需要定期向监管机构和投资方报告最新情况。

投资方往往受到其个人财富门槛的限制，不能完全参与其中。表面上，这是对投资方的一种保护，以确保他们了解全貌，并且将损失控制在自身承受范围之内。但实际上，这却加剧了贫富差距，并产生相反的效果，可用于项目投资的总资金量大大减少。

## Trust Requirement
## 信任要求

Today, capital contributors must fully part with their capital and trust the project team to wisely deploy it towards the stated objectives. Combined with information asymmetry, this trust requirement creates significant risk for capital contributors, and is ultimately largely responsible for reducing the total amount of capital available to projects. The myriad regulations designed to mitigate this problem have unwanted chilling effects of their own, and are only partially successful at achieving their stated goal.

What if there were a way to change the game so that capital contributors didn't need to part with their capital until actually deployed in service of the project? What if capital contributors didn't need to place their trust entirely in a combination of the project team and a slow, expensive legal system? What if we could enable the kind of transparency and information symmetry that current regulations strive to promote, but without needing costly filings and disclosures? Imagine how much capital could be freed up to fund new, valuable projects!

今天，投资方必须完全放弃他们对资金的掌控，并相信项目团队会明智地将资金用于既定目标。再加上信息不对称，这种信任要求给投资人带来了巨大的风险，并最终在很大程度上减少了项目可用资金总量。很多旨在缓解这一问题的法规本身就产生了不受欢迎的寒蝉效应，而且只实现了部分既定目标。

如果有一种方法可以改变游戏规则，使投资人在实际参与到项目中之前仍然对于资金享有控制权，会怎么样？如果投资人不需要把他们的信任完全寄托在项目团队和缓慢、昂贵的法律系统的组合上呢？如果我们能够实现现行法规努力促进的那种透明度和信息对称性，而不需要昂贵的申报，会怎么样？想象一下，有多少资金可以被释放出来用于投资全新的、有价值的项目！

## Community Contribution Opportunity 社区贡献的机会

We think there is such a way.

我们认为有这样一种方式。

Using DAO smart contracts, we can enable capital contributors to fund projects while simultaneously maintaining custody and control over their capital. In other words, custody of the capital doesn't pass to the project team until they actually spend the funds, and, even then, the capital contributors have the ability to withdraw those funds if they disagree with any aspect of how that tranche of funds will be spent.

We can extend this concept even further. By introducing a project token that represents their capital contribution, we can allow capital contributors to maintain custody and control over the value they contributed over the entire life of a project, long after their capital has been deployed.

The same concept of exit rights – the ability to withdraw capital at any time, including in response to an unwanted proposal to spend it – also gives capital contributors a form of governance power over how the collective capital is deployed. This represents yet another form of protection for capital contributors, and by engaging them in governance it also brings them more deeply into the project's community. For decentralized communities (including DAOs) for whom the size and quality of their community is crucial, the latter is particularly valuable.

We call this new construct a **Community Contribution Opportunity** (CCO) because it draws capital contributions to a project from within its existing extended community, including the initial project team's network, the project's early participants or users, other contributors, etc. Even if some capital contributions happen to originate from outside that network, the active role in governance that a CCO induces them to take brings those contributors into the community. This is in direct contrast to more passive forms of capital coordination in which most investors remain at arms length from the project itself.

One abstract way to think about a CCO is as [Reg CF-style](https://www.sec.gov/education/smallbusiness/exemptofferings/regcrowdfunding) crowdfunding but where the contributors a) can pull back their funding if something goes awry, and b) receive governance power over and long term alignment with the project.

How does a CCO actually work? In the next section, we'll explore that in detail.

使用 DAO 智能合约，我们可以使出资人为项目提供资金，同时拥有其资本的托管权和控制权。换句话说，在项目团队实际使用资金之前，资金依旧由贡献者保管。而且，即使那时贡献者不同意使用该批资金，他们也有权力撤回这些资金。

我们可以进一步扩展这个概念。通过引入代表其资本贡献的项目代币，我们可以允许贡献者在项目的整个生命周期内，甚至在他们的资金使用后的很长时间内，仍然对其贡献资金享有保管权和控制权。

我们称这种新结构为社区贡献机会 (Community Contribution Opportunity, CCO)，因为它从现有的扩展社区中为项目吸引资金，包括初始项目团队的网络、项目的早期参与者或用户、其他贡献者等。即使一些资金碰巧来自该网络之外，CCO 引导他们在治理中发挥的积极作用也会将这些出资人带入社区。这与更为被动的资本协调形式形成了直接对比，在这种资本协调形式中，大多数投资者与项目本身保持着一定的距离。

同样的退出权的概念——随时撤出资本的能力，包括对不受欢迎的开销提案的回应——也赋予了资本贡献者部署集体资本的治理权。这是对资本贡献者的另一种保护形式，通过参与治理，更深入地融入项目社区。对于去中心化社区 (包括 DAO) 来说，社区的规模和质量至关重要，后者尤其有价值。

一种抽象的思考方式是将 CCO 视为 Reg cf 风格的众筹，但在这种情况下，贡献者 a) 可以在出现问题时撤回他们的资金，b) 获得项目的治理权并与项目保持长期一致。

CCO 是如何运作的？在下一节中，我们将详细探索这个问题。

## CCO Ingredients CCO 组成要素

The most important part of a CCO is the community (it’s right there in the name!). Within the community, there are two main roles: the project team and the capital contributors. These labels are imperfect and used here solely for the purposes of concreteness. These roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and there is often significant overlap – it’s common for members of the project team to contribute their own capital, or for capital contributors to start making other kinds of contributions as well – but we’ll distinguish between them here for the sake of explanation.

The **project team** comprises the initial members of the group that contribute work, time, and expertise to the project. They are seeking capital for the project in order to expand their ability to dedicate more time, to bring in additional contributors, pay necessary expenses, or a combination of all three in order to advance their project to the next stage.

The members of the project team will have direct governance rights (in the form of voting shares) over the capital contributed by the community. As we'll shortly see, however, this does not mean that the project team collectively has exclusive control over the capital.

The capital contributors are the members of the community (existing or new) that have capital to contribute to the project. They are seeking some kind of return on their capital, whether to themselves (i.e., similar to an investment) or for the community (i.e., similar to a grant or donation), or both. By design, CCOs promote long-term engagement within the community, so CCO capital contributors tend to be values-aligned rather than speculators.

Through the exit rights conferred by their economic shares (explained below), the capital contributors can exercise indirect governance rights over the capital they contribute. In this way, even those capital contributors that don't also assume the role of project team member end up taking an active role in the community.

CCO 最重要的部分是社区 (它就在 COO 名称中有所体现!) 在社区中，有两个主要角色：项目团队和资本贡献者。这些标签尚不完善，在此仅用于具体化的目的。这些角色不一定是相互排斥的，往往有很大的重叠——项目团队成员贡献他们自己的资金是很常见的，或者资本贡献者也开始做出其他类型的贡献——但是为了对此进行阐述，我们在这里将对此进行区分。

项目团队由小组初始成员组成，他们为项目贡献了工作、时间和专业知识。他们正在为项目寻找资金，以便支撑他们投入更多时间，引进更多的贡献者，支付必要的费用，或三者结合，以便推动项目进入下一个阶段。

项目团队的成员将对社区贡献的资本拥有直接管理权 (以投票权的形式)。然而，正如我们将看到的那样，这并不意味着项目团队集体拥有对资本的独家控制权。
资本贡献者是社区的成员 (现有成员或新成员)，他们可以利用资金对项目做出贡献。他们当然也在寻求回报率，无论是对自己 (类似于投资) 还是对社区 (类似于赠款或捐赠)，或者两者都有。从设计上讲，CCO 促进了社区内部的长期参与，因此 CCO 的资本贡献者往往价值观一致，而不是投机者。

通过其经济份额授予的退出权 (如下所述)，资本贡献者可以对其所贡献的资金行使间接治理权。通过这种方式，即使那些没有承担项目团队成员角色的资本贡献者最终也会在社区中扮演积极的角色。

## Tools 工具

Together, the project team and capital contributors will use several web3-native tools to coordinate on the CCO:

项目团队和投资人将使用几种 web3 原生工具来协调 CCO：

- A Moloch DAO

- Capital

- Project token

- Transmutation minion

- Vault smart contract

### Moloch DAO

The [Moloch DAO framework](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/moloch-dao) was inspired by [the original Moloch DAO](https://molochdao.com/) and has since been used by [hundreds of DAOs](https://app.daohaus.club/explore). It has several core properties that are key to a CCO:

- Non-transferable membership in the form of shares. There are two types of shares: "full shares" with full voting rights and "loot shares" with economic rights and indirect governance power.

- Weighted voting rights, represented by the number of full shares a member has.

- Economic exit rights (aka "ragequit"), represented by the total number of shares and loot shares a member has, which is also a limited form of governance power. This is the most important property for a CCO.

- Proposals involve a voting period (during which members vote with their full shares) and a grace period (during which any member who didn't vote yes can ragequit). A passed proposal can be executed only after the grace period.

A Moloch DAO can hold assets (e.g., capital) in its treasury, and that capital is collectively controlled by the members of the DAO. Members with full shares can vote on proposals for how to deploy the capital. Members with loot shares can ragequit at any time to leave with their pro rata portion of the capital in the DAO treasury.

Importantly, the ragequit mechanism allows members to leave the DAO during the grace period after a proposal passes, but before it can be executed. This creates strong protections for members with minority shares, since they're never at the mercy of the rest of the DAO and can always leave with their capital before it is spent. Ragequit is what gives CCO capital contributors control over their capital — without relinquishing custody! — even while it remains available to fund the project.

In the context of a CCO, individuals on the project team get full shares, typically in proportion to how much value they've created for the project thus far. Capital contributors receive loot shares, in proportion to how much capital they contribute.

Moloch DAO 框架的灵感来自于最初的 Moloch DAO，后来被数百个 DAO 使用。有几个核心属性是 CCO 的关键：

- 以股份形式存在的不可转让的成员资格。股份有两种类型：具有完全投票权的 "全额股份" 和具有经济权利和间接治理权的 "掠夺股份"。

- 加权投票权，由一个成员拥有的全额股份数量代表。

- 经济退出权（又称 "愤怒退出"），由一个成员拥有的股份和掠夺股份总数代表，这也是一种有限的治理权力。这是一个 CCO 最重要的属性。

- 提案涉及一个投票期（在此期间，成员使用他们的全部股份投票）和一个宽限期（在此期间，任何没有投赞成票的成员都可以愤怒退出）。通过的提案只能在宽限期之后执行。

Moloch DAO 可以在其国库中持有资产（如资本），这些资本由 DAO 的成员集体控制。拥有全额股份的成员可以就如何部署资金的提案进行投票。拥有掠夺性股份的成员可以在任何时候愤怒退出，带着他们在 DAO 国库中按比例分配的资本离开。

重要的是，愤怒退出机制允许成员在提案通过后的宽限期内离开 DAO，但必须保证在提案执行之前离开。这为拥有少数股份的成员提供了强有力的保护，因为他们不会受 DAO 其他成员的控制，可以选择在他们的资金被消耗完之前离开。愤怒退出机制使 CCO 的资本贡献者能够控制他们的资本——而不放弃保管权！即使它仍为该项目提供资金。

在 CCO 的背景下，项目团队的个人获得全额股份，通常与他们迄今为止为项目创造的价值成正比。资本贡献者获得的是掠夺性股份，与他们贡献的资金量成正比。

### Capital

Initially held only by the capital contributors, the capital must be in an ERC20 token form. Typically it is a stablecoin like DAI, but could also be some other money-like currency (e.g., wrapped ETH or wrapped Bitcoin), or even other assets such as personal tokens. As long as it can be represented as an ERC20-compatible token, anything that the project can leverage to help achieve its objectives can serve as capital. The project team determines which types of capital the CCO will accept.

最初只由 Capital 贡献者持有，资本必须是 ERC20 代币形式。通常情况下，它是像 DAI 这样的稳定币，但也可以是一些其他类型（例如，封装的 ETH 或封装的比特币），甚至是其他资产，如个人代币。只要它可以表示兼容 ERC20 的代币，任何项目可以利用来帮助其实现目标的东西都可以作为资本。项目团队决定 CCO 将接受哪种类型的资金。

### Project Token 项目代币

The purpose of the project token is to represent the value that all individuals contribute to the project, including "sweat" contributions from the project team as well as both capital contributions and governance activities from the capital contributors.

Typically, the token is a standard ERC20 token, though some modifications can be valuable (see the Modifications section for an example).

During the CCO, the token serves as a record of contributions to the project. After the CCO, the token can play subsequent roles depending on the needs of the project. For a project building an open web3 protocol, for example, it could act as the governance token for the protocol. For a project establishing an autonomous social community, it could serve as the social token. Or it could simply remain a record of past contributions.

Depending on the future role the token will play, the project team can select what properties the token should have, such as a fixed or adjustable supply, the initial supply, etc.

项目代币的目的是代表所有个人对项目的价值，包括项目团队的 "汗水" 贡献，以及资本贡献者的资本贡献和治理活动。

通常情况下，它是一个标准的 ERC20 代币，不过一些修改可能是有价值的（参见修改部分的示例）。

在 CCO 期间，代币作为对项目贡献的记录。在 CCO 之后，代币可以根据项目的需要扮演后续角色。例如，对于构建开放 web3 协议的项目，它可以充当协议的治理代币。对于建立自治社区的项目，它可以作为社交代币。或者，它可能只是过往贡献的记录。

根据代币未来将扮演的角色，项目团队可以选择代币应该具有的属性，如固定或可调整的供应量，初始供应等。

### Transmutation Minion

Moloch Minions are smart contracts that add capabilities to a Moloch DAO. They allow a DAO to execute more complex actions, and are controlled by the same proposal process as standard Moloch DAO functions.

The purpose of the Transmutation minion is to convert the capital into the project token as the capital leaves the DAO. This is the process that enables the system to be fully non-custodial, giving capital contributors control over the value of their contributions throughout the life of the project.

The Transmutation minion holds enough project tokens to (eventually) replace the capital in the DAO. When the project team makes a proposal to deploy some amount of capital (e.g., for expenses or to pay developers) and the proposal is executed, that amount of capital leaves the DAO. At the same time, the Transmutation minion replaces the capital with the commensurate amount of project tokens.

As capital is deployed in service of the project, it is replaced in the DAO by the project token. Since the capital originally came from the capital contributors, all of the project tokens that replace it go to the capital contributors.


Here is an early example of a [Transmutation minion smart contract](https://github.com/HausDAO/TransmutationSummoner).

Moloch Minions 是为 Moloch DAO 添加功能的智能合约。它们允许 DAO 执行更复杂的操作，并由与标准 Moloch DAO 功能相同的提案过程控制。
Transmutation minion 的目的是在资本离开 DAO 时将资本转换成项目代币。这是一个使系统完全非托管的过程，让资本贡献者在项目的整个生命周期内控制其贡献的价值。
Transmutation minion 持有足够的项目代币来（最终）取代 DAO 中的资本。当项目团队提出部署一定数量的资金（例如，用于支出或支付开发人员费用）的建议，并且该建议被执行时，该数量的资金就会离开 DAO。同时，Transmutation minion 用相应数量的项目代币替换资本。
当资本被部署到项目服务中时，它在 DAO 中会被项目代币替换。由于资金最初来自于资本贡献者，因此所有替换它的项目代币都归资本贡献者所有。

以下是 Transmutation minion 智能合约的早期示例。

### Vault

The purpose of the Vault is to hold project tokens for later distribution to various recipients once a predetermined unlocking condition is met. The allocation of project tokens is hard-coded into the Vault smart contract; each recipient (and only the recipient) can later claim their allocation from the Vault.

The most important recipients are initial members of the project team, and the Vault is where virtually all of their allocation of project tokens will come from over the course of the CCO. Locking up the project team's tokens until the capital is spent creates a strong incentive for them to complete the planned work, and to do so in a way that the capital contributors support.

Other recipients can include a future project DAO treasury, allocations for future members of the project team, distributions to project participants or users (e.g., in the form of a retroactive airdrop), or anything that is relevant to helping the project succeed.

The unlocking condition is typically when all capital has been deployed from the DAO. At this point, the planned work should be finished and so the project team and capital contributors can start to receive their project tokens (by claiming from the Vault and ragequitting from the DAO, respectively).

Here is an early example of a [Vault smart contract](https://github.com/HausDAO/wc/blob/develop/contracts/Trust.sol).

Vault 的目的是保存项目代币，以便在满足预定的解锁条件后分发给不同的接受者。项目代币的分配被硬编码到 Vault 智能合约中；每个接受者（而且只有接受者）以后可以从 Vault 中领取他们的分配。

最重要的接受者是项目团队的初始成员，在 CCO 过程中，Vault 是他们几乎所有项目代币分配的来源。锁定项目团队的代币，直到资金花完，这为他们完成计划的工作创造了强大的激励，并以资本贡献者支持的方式来完成。

其他接受者可以包括未来的项目 DAO 国库，项目团队未来成员的分配，项目参与者或用户的分配（例如，以追溯空投的形式），或者任何帮助项目成功的有关事务。

解锁条件通常是 DAO 中所有资本部署完毕时。此时，计划中的工作应该已经完成，因此项目团队和资本贡献者可以开始收到他们的项目代币（分别从 Vault 和 DAO 愤怒退出）。

下面是 Vault 智能合约的早期示例。

## Lifecycle of a CCO

CCO 生命周期

The life cycle of a CCO breaks down into four distinct phases:

- Setup

- Contribution

- Buidl

- Distribution

We'll walk through each of them to outline the entire lifecycle of a CCO.

CCO 的生命周期分为四个不同的阶段：

- Setup

- Contribution

- Buidl

- Distribution

我们将通过每个阶段来概述 CCO 的整个生命周期。


### Phase 1: Setup 第 1 阶段：设置

In this phase, the project team gets everything ready for the CCO. This involves the following steps:

1. Summon the DAO, with the individuals on the project team receiving full shares (typically in proportion to their contributions to the project thus far).

2. Establish the CCO parameters:

  a. Global min and max contribution amounts.

  b. Individual capital contributor min and max contribution amounts.

3. Establish the project token allocation (e.g., how much goes to the project team, the capital contributors, and other future recipients).

4. Establish the exchange rate between capital and the project token. This is important for Transmutation.

5. Create the project token, with the specified supply parameters.

6. Deploy the Transmutation minion smart contract.

7. Send the relevant project token amount to the Transmutation minion.

8. Deploy the Vault smart contract, instantiated with individual recipient allocation and claim logic.

9. Send the relevant project token amount to the Vault.

10. Send enough project tokens to the DAO to back the project team's full shares. This ensures that the capital contributors' loot shares are not diluted.

Also in this phase, capital contributors get their capital ready.

在这个阶段，项目团队为 CCO 做好一切准备。这涉及到以下步骤：

1. 召集 DAO，项目团队的个人获得全额份额 (通常按照他们迄今为止对项目的贡献的比例)。

2. 建立 CCO 参数：
  a. 全局最小和最大贡献金额。
  b. 个人资本贡献者的最低和最高贡献额。

3. 建立项目代币分配（例如，有多少分配给项目团队、资本贡献者和其他未来接受者）。

4. 建立资本和项目代币之间的汇率。这一点对 Transmutation 很重要。

5. 创建项目代币，并指定供应参数。

6. 部署 Transmutation minion 智能合约。

7. 将相关的项目代币金额发送给 Transmutation minion。

8. 部署 Vault 智能合约，并将其实例化为单个接受者的分配和索赔逻辑。

9. 将相关的项目代币金额发送到 Vault。

10. 向 DAO 发送足够的项目代币以支持项目团队的全部份额。这确保了资本贡献者的掠夺份额不被稀释。

也是在这个阶段，资本贡献者做好资金准备。

> CCO 第一阶段（设置）结束。项目代币在 Transmutation Minion 和 Vault 中，项目团队是 Moloch DAO 的股东，资本贡献者已经做好资金准备（以贡献代币的形式）。

## Phase 2: Contribution 第二阶段：贡献

After the Setup Phase, everything is ready for capital contributors to start making their contributions. To make their contributions, each capital contributor makes a membership proposal to the DAO, including their capital as "tribute" and requesting the commensurate amount of loot shares.

If the proposal is formulated correctly — i.e., tribute is within the between the min and max capital contribution amount and correct number of requested loot shares — the project team will use their full shares to vote yes on the proposal. If it passes, once the grace period is finished, the contributed capital enters the DAO treasury and the proposer receives their loot shares. (The recommended ratio is 10 loot shares for every 1 unit of capital, which allows the project team to back its own full shares with a relatively lower amount of the project token.)

If the proposal is formulated correctly — i.e., tribute is within the between the min and max capital contribution amount and correct number of requested loot shares — the project team will use their full shares to vote yes on the proposal. If it passes, once the grace period is finished, the contributed capital enters the DAO treasury and the proposer receives their loot shares.

Remember, a capital contributor can ragequit their loot shares to leave with their capital at any point. If they see something they don't like even at this early stage, they can leave with nothing lost.

If and when the global contribution max is reached, this phase is complete and the CCO moves to Phase 3. If the global min is not reached, then, like Kickstarter, the entire thing unwinds and capital contributors can ragequit to retrieve their capital.

设置阶段之后，资本贡献者准备就绪可以开始做出贡献。为了做出贡献，每个资本贡献者向 DAO 提出会员提案，包括他们的资本作为 "贡品"，并要求获得相应数量的掠夺份额。

如果提案的制定正确——即 "贡品"在最小和最大的资本贡献额之间，以及要求的掠夺份额数量正确——项目团队将使用他们的全部份额对提案投赞成票。如果通过，一旦宽限期结束，贡献的资本就会进入 DAO 国库，提案人就会收到他们的掠夺股份。

记住，资本贡献者可以在任何时候愤怒退出掠夺份额，带走资金。如果他们看到他们不喜欢的东西，即使在这个早期阶段，他们也可以离开而不损失什么。

如果达到了全局贡献最大值，这个阶段就完成了，CCO 将进入第三阶段。如果没有达到全局最小值，那么，就像 Kickstarter 一样，整个项目就会解散，资本贡献者可以愤怒退出，以撤回他们的资金。

> 在 CCO 的第二阶段（贡献），资本出资人将其资本（以贡献代币的形式）送入 Moloch DAO，并获得掠夺份额作为回报。

## Phase 3: Buidl 第 3 阶段：建立

This is the phase where the magic happens.

The project team works on their project, deploying the capital periodically over time to fund their activities. This can include covering expenses, compensating contributors, or whatever is needed to advance the project towards its goals.

The capital contributors remain involved throughout this phase. As described above, often this is directly as members of the project team themselves. And if they are not already part of the project team, the economic exit rights give them a role in guiding the project team and providing community-building resources.

To deploy the capital, the project team makes proposals to spend it. When capital leaves the DAO it is replaced by (i.e., Transmuted into) the project token at the exchange rate established during Phase 1.

[img]
> During Phase 3 of a CCO (Buidl), the Project team makes proposals to deploy the capital (in the form of contribution tokens) in service of the project's initiatives. As the capital leaves the DAO, it is Transmuted into the project token.


At any time — including after a proposal passes but before it is executed — a capital contributor can ragequit to receive back the remaining portion of their capital along with their portion of the project tokens that have been transmuted into the DAO thus far. This can happen for any reason; remember, the capital contributors maintain full custody of the value they contribute.

For example, a capital contributor could disagree with the way the project team is spending the capital, disagree with the direction that the project has taken, perceive that the project team is not being transparent enough, or suspect that the project team is attempting to steal the funds. They could even simply have found a better use elsewhere for their capital.

Because capital contributors always have this option, they wield a fair amount of governance power over how the capital is spent even though they don't vote directly on proposals. To ensure that they maintain access to the capital to fund their activities, the project team needs to give frequent, transparent updates to the capital contributors. Often, they will seek preliminary feedback from capital contributors to create alignment before submitting a new proposal for the next tranche of funding.

Once all of the capital has been deployed and only project tokens remain in the DAO, this phase is complete and the CCO moves to Phase 4.


这是发生奇迹的阶段。

项目团队致力于他们的项目，随着时间的推移定期部署资金，为他们的活动提供资金。这包括支付费用，补偿贡献者，或任何推动项目实现其目标的需要。

在这一阶段，资本贡献者仍参与其中。如上所述，他们通常是直接作为项目团队的成员。如果他们尚未成为项目团队的成员，经济退出权也可以使他们在指导项目组和提供社区建设资源方面发挥作用。

为了部署资金，项目团队提出提出使用资金提案。当资金离开 DAO 时，它将根据第一阶段期间建立的汇率被兑换（即转化为）成项目代币。

> 在 CCO（Buidl）的第三阶段，项目团队提出建议，部署资本（以贡献代币的形式），为项目的举措服务。随着资本离开 DAO，它被转化为项目代币。

在任何时候——包括提案通过后但未执行之前——资本贡献者都可以选择愤怒退出，收回其剩余部分的资金，以及到目前为止已转换为 DAO 的项目代币的部分。这种情况随时可能发生；记住，资本贡献者对他们贡献的价值具有完全监管权。

例如，资本贡献者可能不同意项目团队花费资金的方式，不同意项目采取的方向，认为项目团队不够透明，或者怀疑项目团队试图窃取资金。他们甚至可能只是在其他地方为他们的资金找到了更好的用途。

由于资本贡献者总是有这个选择，即使他们不直接对提案投票，他们对如何使用资金仍拥有相当大的管理权。为了确保能够获得资金，项目团队需要经常向资本贡献者公开项目最新情况。通常情况下，他们会寻求资本贡献者的初步反馈，以便在提交支出下一笔资金的新提案之前达成一致。

一旦所有资金部署完毕，并且 DAO 中只剩下项目代币，本阶段就完成了，CCO 就会进入第四阶段。

## Phase 4: Distribution 第 4 阶段：分配

At this point, there is no more capital in the DAO for the project team to spend on the project, which triggers two things to happen simultaneously.

For one, the capital contributors can ragequit their loot shares from the DAO to receive their portion of the tokens. The project team can also ragequit their full shares from the DAO, though by design the amount of project tokens they receive in this way is minimal compared to what they receive from the Vault.

>During Phase 4 of a CCO (Distribution), all capital has been spent and all initiatives are complete. At this point, Capital Contributors redeem their loot shares for their portion of the project tokens that were Transmuted into the DAO.

Additionally, the Vault's unlocking condition is triggered. The project tokens become claimable by the recipients, including the members of the project team.

And that's a CCO! The project has advanced to the next level, the project team has grown and been able to compensate its contributors for their work, and both the project team and capital contributors have received project tokens representing their respective contributions. All without any actor relinquishing custody of their capital until it was deployed in service of the project.

此时，DAO 中没有更多的资金供项目团队使用，这引发了两件事同时发生。

其一，资本贡献者可以愤怒退出他们在 DAO 中的掠夺份额，以获得对应比例的项目代币。项目团队也可以从 DAO 中愤怒退出他们的全部股份，尽管根据设计，与他们从 Vault 获得的代币相比，他们通过这种方式获得的项目代币数量是微不足道的。

>在 CCO 的第四阶段（分配），所有资金都已被使用，所有的计划都已完成。在这一点上，资本贡献者可以用他们的掠夺者份额赎回被转化为 DAO 项目代币的部分。

此外，Vault 的解锁条件被触发。接受者，包括项目团队成员可以获取项目代币。

这些条件触发了 Vault 的解锁，允许项目团队的个别成员从 Vault 中获取对应比例的项目代币。

这就是一个 CCO 运作的阶段！项目已经推进到下一阶段，项目团队已经成长，并能够对其贡献者的工作进行补偿，而且项目团队和资本贡献者都收到了代表各自贡献的项目代币。在资金部署的全过程里，没有人放弃对其资金的托管权。

## Modifications 修改

Many modifications to this foundational construct are possible. Here are a few ideas.

对这一基本结构的许多修改是可能发生的。以下是一些想法。

## Capital Contributors Receive Full Shares 资本贡献者获得全部股份

Projects that want to involve capital contributors even more deeply in the community can opt to give them full shares instead of loot shares. This needs to be handled with intention and with care to ensure that the distribution of shares remains sufficiently decentralized to avoid plutocratic capture and support true community governance.

想让资本贡献者更深入地参与社区的项目可以选择给他们全额股份而不是掠夺股份。需要谨慎处理这一点，以确保股份的分配足够去中心化并避免财阀攫取，支持真正的社区治理。

## Non-transferrable Project Token 不可转让的项目代币

Making project tokens non-transferrable until a later date creates flexibility for additional activities prior to the token becoming liquid.

The most basic benefit is to projects that rely on tokens not being available until a particular time or condition. For these projects, a capital contributor receiving some tokens after ragequitting in the middle of the Buidl Phase is a major risk. Making project tokens non-transferrable preserves the non-custodial nature of the CCO, but prevents the ragequitter from doing anything with their early-gotten tokens.

Another benefit is to projects expecting to have multiple phases. Such projects may want to conduct multiple CCOs, which would likely be easier if there aren't a bunch of loose project tokens floating around.

Yet another use case is for projects that will be making retroactive distributions to users or setting up liquidity in a decentralized exchange. To promote fairness, the project team may not want anybody to receive the project tokens before anybody else, and executing on that goal requires time to set up properly. Preventing token transferability until those activities are fully set up can help align all the timing for maximum fairness.

One thing to consider is that ragequit requires some transferability. The token needs to be transferred from the DAO treasury to the ragequitter's wallet. We can account for this by creating logic within the token smart contract that allows the DAO, but nobody else, to transfer the token.

让项目代币在在特定时间之前不可转让，这为代币成为流动资产之前的其他活动创造了灵活性。

这一点有利于那些依靠在特定时间或条件下代币才可转让的项目。对于这些项目来说，一个资本贡献者在建设阶段中期愤怒退出后收到部分代币是一个重大风险行为。使项目代币不可转让保留了 CCO 的非监管性质，但阻止了愤怒退出者利用他们早期获取的代币进行任何操作。

另一个好处是对那些预期有多个阶段的项目。这样的项目可能想要进行多个 CCO，如果没有一堆松散的项目代币，这可能会更容易。

然而，另一个用例是对于那些将向用户进行追溯分配或在去中心化交易所建立流动性的项目。为了促进公平，项目团队可能不希望任何人在其他人之前收到项目的代币，而执行这个目标需要时间来正确设置。在这些活动完全建立起来之前，防止代币的可转让性可以帮助调整所有的时间，以达到最大的公平性。

有一点需要考虑的是，ragequit 需要一定的可转移性。代币需要从 DAO 金库转移到 ragequitter 的钱包里。我们可以通过在代币智能合约中创建逻辑来说明这一点，允许 DAO，但不允许其他人转移代币。

## No Project Token (Pseudo-CCO) 没有项目代币（伪 CCO）

Some projects do not need or want to have a token at all. Such projects could opt for a pseudo-CCO, where there is no token, no Transmutation, no Vault, and no Distribution Phase. Capital contributors in a pseudo-CCO maintain custody of their capital until it is deployed (to their liking), but they don't receive a representation of their contribution and have less reason to remain engaged with the community once the CCO is complete.

Other projects may want to have a token but are, for one reason or another, not ready to create one just yet. These projects could also opt to conduct a pseudo-CCO, with a promise to capital contributors that they will distribute a token at some point in the future. Note that this breaks the trustless nature of a true CCO, and therefore carries substantially more risk for all parties involved.

有些项目根本不需要或不希望有代币。这样的项目可以选择伪 CCO，没有代币，没有转换，没有 Vault，也没有分配阶段。伪 CCO 中的资本贡献者对其资本拥有保管权，直到其资金被部署（按照他们的喜好），但他们收到他们的贡献证明，一旦 CCO 完成，他们就没有理由继续参与社区建设。

其他项目可能希望有一个代币，但由于各种原因，还没有准备好创建代币。这些项目也可以选择进行伪 CCO，向资本贡献者承诺他们将在未来的某个时间点分发代币。请注意，这打破了真正的 CCO 的无信任特质，因此所有参与方面临的风险大大增加。

## Example: The DAOhaus CCO

In 2020, DAOhaus conducted the first ever CCO to help fund the build-out of our new platform for community-centric DAOs. Here's a quick rundown on how we did it:

2020 年，DAOhaus 进行了第一次 CCO，以帮助以社区为中心的 DAO 建立新平台提供资金。以下是关于我们执行过程中简短介绍：

**Phase 1**: We summoned a [new Moloch DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x283bdc900b6ec9397abb721c5bbff5ace46e0f50), with previous contributors to DAOhaus receiving full shares. We created the $HAUS token. We also deployed the [Transmutation minion](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x371273396027eF9D79bA66F4c48258d88648654D) and [Vault](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x09D32bB9D03Af44cb83c8C128ffd7b5AC7b33834) (which was called the Trust back then). Finally, we created the[$HAUS token](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0xb0C5f3100A4d9d9532a4CfD68c55F1AE8da987Eb/token-transfers) and transferred the appropriate amounts into the minion and Vault.

**Phase 2**: We invited members of our extended community (friends, connections, the MetaCartel family, other DAO-focused people and projects) to contribute DAI to the cause. Over the course of 2 weeks, 39 members of the community (including both individuals and DAOs!) contributed capital and received loot shares.

**Phase 3**: Next, we started building. As the DAOhaus project team wrote code, designed new user experiences, and managed our community, we made Transmutation proposals against the DAO to pay for expenses and compensate contributors. The latter allowed us to double the number of contributors, many of whom are still contributing to DAOhaus today! Along the way, we kept the capital contributors informed of our progress and direction. A number of those capital contributors are now key members of the project team!

**Phase 4**: After around 6 months, all DAI in the DAO had been transmuted into $HAUS tokens. At that point, capital contributors ragequit the DAO to receive their portion of the $HAUS and the project team claimed their $HAUS from the Vault. We then summoned a [new DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xef3d8c4fbb1860fceab16595db7e650cd5ad51c1) to govern the DAOhaus core contributor activities, which we still use today.

Our CCO helped us build the new version of the DAOhaus platform, expand our community with more contributors and users and advisors, and laid a strong foundation for future sustainable and values-oriented growth. All without requiring that our capital contributors trust us or relinquish custody of their assets.

第一阶段：我们召集了一个新的 Moloch DAO，之前的 DAOhaus 贡献者获得了全部股份。我们创建了$HAUS 代币。我们还部署了 Transmutation minion 和 Vault（当时被称为信托）。最后，我们创建了$HAUS 代币，并将适当的金额转移到了 minion 和 Vault 中。

第二阶段：我们邀请扩展社区的成员（朋友、人脉、MetaCartel 家族、其他专注 DAO 的人和项目）为这项事业贡献 DAI。在两周的时间里，社区的 39 名成员（包括个人和 DAO！）贡献了资金并获得了掠夺份额。

第三阶段：接下来，我们开始建设。随着 DAOhaus 项目团队编写代码，设计新的用户体验，并管理我们的社区，我们对 DAO 提出了 Transmutation 建议，以支付费用并补偿贡献者。后者使我们的贡献者数量增加了一倍，其中许多人今天仍在为 DAOhaus 做贡献。在这一过程中，我们不断向资本贡献者汇报我们的进展和方向。其中一些资本贡献者现在是项目团队的关键成员。

第四阶段：大约 6 个月后，DAO 中的所有 DAI 都被转化为 HAUS 的代币。在这一点上，资本贡献者能够愤怒退出 DAO，以获得对应比例的 HAUS，而项目团队则从 Vault 中获取 HAUS。然后我们召集了一个新的 DAO 来管理 DAOhaus 核心贡献者的活动，我们今天仍在使用它。

CCO 帮助我们建立了新版本的 DAOhaus 平台，用更多的贡献者和用户以及顾问来扩大我们的社区，并为未来可持续和以价值观为导向的增长奠定了坚实的基础。这一切都不需要我们的资本贡献者信任我们或放弃他们的资产托管权。

## Conclusion: Benefits of CCOs
## 结论：CCO 的优点

We believe that CCOs are a significant advancement in capital coordination. We look forward to many decentralized communities -- and perhaps other types of projects! -- using CCOs to magnify the positive impact they are able to make on the world.

Your decentralized community or DAO can run a CCO today using the DAOhaus platform. We are bringing on alpha partners as we further refine these capabilities. Please reach out to set up a conversation!

To recap, here is a list of the core benefits of the CCO framework:

我们认为，CCO 是资本协调机制方面的重大进步。我们期待更多去中心化的社区——也许还有其他类型的项目——利用 CCOs 进一步扩大他们产生的积极影响力。
你的去中心化社区或 DAO 现在可以使用 DAOhaus 平台运行 CCO。

随着我们进一步完善这些功能，我们在这里简单概括一下 CCO 框架的核心优势：

### Benefits to Capital Contributors 对资本贡献者的好处

- Retain full custody of their capital until it is deployed, including the ability to exit if they don't like the direction things are going

- Maintain governance power over how the capital is deployed

- Reduced information asymmetry between project team and capital contributors

- Built-in tranching of capital

- Significantly less requirement to trust the project team

- Overall lower risk

- Greater opportunity for less wealthy people to participate

- 在资金部署之前，保留对其资本的全部托管权，包括如果对发展方向不满意时，有权选择退出
- 保持对资本部署的治理权
- 减少项目团队和资本贡献者的信息不对称
- 资本的内部分配
- 减少对项目团队的信任成本
- 总体风险降低
- 降低参与门槛

### Benefits to Projects 对项目的好处

- More capital available to advance the project's goals

- Folds capital contributors into the community where they can serve as advisors or even fellow builders

- Less need to rely on larger capital contributors (e.g., venture capital firms) for funding

- Governance of the project remains decentralized


- 更多的资金可用于推进项目目标

- 将资本贡献者汇集到社区中，他们可以作为顾问或甚至是建造者伙伴

- 减少对于较大资本贡献者 (如风险投资公司) 资金的依赖

- 项目治理保持去中心化
