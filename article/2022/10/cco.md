**译注：**

1. 原文中的「capital contributor」有两种译法「资本贡献者」和「投资者」，后者就是贡献自己的资金以博取更大收益的人，是我们比较熟悉的说法；前者所指涉的范围更大，它既包括投资者，也包括那些不是为了获得金钱回报的人。因为 Web3 项目的愿景都非常远大，不仅仅是简单的金融活动，所以在大多数语境里，我会使用「资本贡献者」这个或许更严谨的说法。

2. 原文中的「capital」有两种译法，「资本」和「资金」，在多数情况下译为「资本」，因为泛指有形资本、无形资本、金融资本和人力资本等各种形式的经济资源。

- A Community Contribution Opportunity (CCO) is a new mechanism for capital coordination that increases the amount of capital available to fund projects by strengthening protections and lowering risks for capital contributors.

- CCO（社区贡献机会）是一种新型的资本配置机制，它可以加强资金安全保障和降低资本贡献者的风险，从而增加可以用于投资的资本总量。

- A CCO uses DAO tooling to orchestrate capital contributions to projects in a non-custodial fashion. Capital contributors maintain custody over their capital and have governance power over how it is spent, embedding them as active participants in the project's community and protecting them from risks without the need for trusted relationships.

- CCO 通过各种 DAO 工具以非托管方式进行项目的资本配置。资本贡献者享有对资本的监管权和治理权，即他们可以决定资本的用途。这能够促使资本贡献者成为项目的积极参与者，不需要和项目团队建立信任关系也能降低自身的风险。

- These reduced risks make contributing capital significantly more attractive, making more capital available to fund projects, especially for decentralized communities and DAOs looking to amplify the positive impact they can have on the world.

- 项目风险的降低使其对资本的吸引力显著增加，于是这类项目会获得更多资本的资助，尤其是那些想要扩大其对世界积极影响的去中心化社区和 DAO 组织。

# **Current problems in capital coordination**

# 当前资本配置机制中存在的问题

Capital coordination is an incredibly powerful concept that has driven many of the advances in human well-being. But it has yet to reach its true potential.

资本配置是一个非常重要的概念，它促进了全人类福祉的进步，但还没有发挥出真正的潜力。

If humanity were able to better coordinate capital, we could fund many more valuable projects to further advance aggregate human well-being and help alleviate the unjust distribution of that well-being.

如果人类可以更好地配置资本，我们就能资助更多有价值的项目，进一步增进人类福祉，改善分配不公的现状。

What's stopping that from happening? There are two big, compounding problems. Current capital coordination mechanisms create information asymmetries and require capital contributors to trust project teams with little recourse. Together, these issues exacerbate the inherent risk of any venture and further limit the amount of capital that would-be contributors are willing to make available to fund projects.

但我们遇到了两个巨大且复杂的难题。首先，当前的资本配置机制会导致**信息不对称**；其次，它要求**资本贡献者在没有足够保障的情况下对项目团队保持信任**。这两个问题作用在一起加剧了投资风险，资本贡献者的意愿会随之降低，投资金额也会减少。

The amount of capital available to fund valuable new projects is inherently limited by the risk of contributing capital to those projects. The higher the perceived risk of losing capital with little to no return, the less interested people are in contributing capital to a project.

有价值的新项目能够募集到多少资本根本上取决于投资这些项目要承担多少风险。投资者觉得赔本的风险越高，他们就越不愿意往项目里投钱。

Downside risk can be offset by the perception of a high likelihood of a positive return (or even a low likelihood of a large return), but the effect is not symmetric: the wealthy are able to accept the high risk of loss in exchange for the chance of outsized returns much easier than the less wealthy, who may not have that luxury. This structural inevitability exacerbates wealth inequality and promotes unjust outcomes.

不过，投资的下行风险可以被高回报率所抵消，即使回报率很低，但只要潜在的收益足够高，也会降低投资者对风险的感知。但是预期收益对风险的影响不是绝对的：富人比穷人更容易接受高风险高回报的投资行为，因为他们有足够的资本。这种不可避免的结构性现实[加剧了贫富差距](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/insights/how-much-does-venture-capital-drive-us-economy)
和分配不公。

## Information Asymmetry

## 信息不对称

A key factor influencing a person's perception of risk is information. The more information you have about the project and related factors, the better you can assess each. But access to information is not equal; project teams know a lot more about what's going on with their project than anybody else, which multiplies the risk perceived by would-be capital contributors.

信息是影响我们风险感知能力的一个关键因素。你所掌握的项目信息越多，就能够更好地评估这个项目。但是获取信息的渠道不是绝对公平的，项目团队比其他任何人都更了解项目的具体情况，这种信息不对称会增加投资者所感知到的风险。

If left unchecked, information asymmetry can result in fraud and theft. To combat it, current laws and regulations impose significant constraints and responsibilities on both project teams and prospective capital contributors.

如果不加以监管，信息不对称还可能导致欺诈。所以为了防止这类事件发生，现有的法律对项目方和投资方都进行了严格的监管。

In order to raise capital from the general public, project teams must register their securities and/or make long, complicated, and expensive regulatory filings to receive approval from regulators (subject to only certain exemptions) and are often required to report regular updates to regulators and capital contributors.

如果要向公众募集资金，项目团队必须先在证券交易委员会注册登记或者进行耗时、复杂且昂贵的监管备案，以获得监管机构的许可，除此之外，他们还要定期向监管机构和投资者汇报项目进展情况。

Capital contributors are often restricted from participating altogether based on an arbitrary threshold of personal wealth. This is (ostensibly) meant as a form of protection for capital contributors to ensure they are knowledgeable and can sustain a "total loss" of the capital they contribute. In reality, it primarily serves to exacerbate wealth inequality and, counterproductively, reduce the total amount of capital available for projects to do good things in the world.

投资者则常常因为个人资产达不到某个（随机选定的）标准而被拦在门外，不能进行投资。这（表面上）是（法律）为了保护那些缺乏知识储备，无法承受本金亏空风险的投资者，但实际上它不仅加剧了贫富差异，还导致本来可以用来为这个世界创造价值的资本变少了。

## Trust Requirement

## 信任难题

Today, capital contributors must fully part with their capital and trust the project team to wisely deploy it towards the stated objectives. Combined with information asymmetry, this trust requirement creates significant risk for capital contributors, and is ultimately largely responsible for reducing the total amount of capital available to projects. The myriad regulations designed to mitigate this problem have unwanted chilling effects of their own, and are only partially successful at achieving their stated goal.

我们通常看到的项目投资模式是这样的：投资者如果想要投资一个项目，他必须转让自己对资本的支配权，相当于他只能选择信任项目团队会合理地分配这笔资金来完成他们所承诺过的目标。这种非常依赖信任关系的投资行为，再加上信息不对称的影响，使投资者面临着巨大的风险，也是导致用来投资的资本总量减少的罪魁祸首之一。虽然政府有针对性地颁布了大量的法律法规，但它们只能发挥部分效力，并不能很好地解决这个问题，反而会引发寒蝉效应。

What if there were a way to change the game so that capital contributors didn't need to part with their capital until actually deployed in service of the project? What if capital contributors didn't need to place their trust entirely in a combination of the project team and a slow, expensive legal system? What if we could enable the kind of transparency and information symmetry that current regulations strive to promote, but without needing costly filings and disclosures? Imagine how much capital could be freed up to fund new, valuable projects!

有没有一种方法可以改变游戏规则，让投资者能够参与项目资本配置的决策，而不需要把所有希望寄托于项目团队和又贵又拖沓的法律系统，并且它还能取代现有的监管机制——繁杂的财务报表和文件——实现真正的公开透明和信息对称？假如这些都能实现，想象一下到时候会释放多少资本用来投资有价值的新项目！

# Community Contribution Opportunity

# CCO（社区贡献机会）

We think there is such a way.

我们认为眼下就有这样一种方法。

Using DAO smart contracts, we can enable capital contributors to fund projects while simultaneously maintaining custody and control over their capital. In other words, custody of the capital doesn't pass to the project team until they actually spend the funds, and, even then, the capital contributors have the ability to withdraw those funds if they disagree with any aspect of how that tranche of funds will be spent.

我们可以使用 DAO 智能合约让资本贡献者在投资的同时能够保有对资金的监管和控制权。换句话说，项目团队只有在真的需要使用资金时钱才会移交给他们，而且只要资本贡献者没有和项目方就资金的用途达成一致，他们就可以撤资。

We can extend this concept even further. By introducing a project token that represents their capital contribution, we can allow capital contributors to maintain custody and control over the value they contributed over the entire life of a project, long after their capital has been deployed.

更进一步地说，通过引入项目代币来代表资本贡献者所贡献的资本价值，在整个项目生命周期里他们始终保有对自己所贡献的那部分价值的监管和控制权，哪怕是在资本投入已经很长时间之后。

The same concept of exit rights – the ability to withdraw capital at any time, including in response to an unwanted proposal to spend it – also gives capital contributors a form of governance power over how the collective capital is deployed. This represents yet another form of protection for capital contributors, and by engaging them in governance it also brings them more deeply into the project's community. For decentralized communities (including DAOs) for whom the size and quality of their community is crucial, the latter is particularly valuable.

我们把这种随时（包括当你不赞成项目团队要把钱花在某个地方时）撤资的能力称为「退出权」，它实际上赋予了资本贡献者对项目资本配置的管理权，这对他们来说是一种变相的保护。而且，让资本贡献者参与项目治理也能够让他们更深地融入社区。对于去中心化社区（包括 DAO 组织）来说，社区的规模和质量至关重要，一个好质量的社区是特别有价值的。

We call this new construct a Community Contribution Opportunity (CCO) because it draws capital contributions to a project from within its existing extended community, including the initial project team's network, the project's early participants or users, other contributors, etc. Even if some capital contributions happen to originate from outside that network, the active role in governance that a CCO induces them to take brings those contributors into the community. This is in direct contrast to more passive forms of capital coordination in which most investors remain at arms length from the project itself.

我们把这种新的机制叫做 CCO（社区贡献机会），因为它可以不断从现有的发展中的社区里吸纳新的资本，对象包括初始项目团队的网络、早期的项目参与者或者用户，以及其他贡献者等等。CCO 能够促使资本贡献者积极参与项目的治理，所以如果有人在项目网络之外进行了资本贡献，CCO 也会把他们吸引到项目中来。CCO 和那种更被动的资本配置形式（投资者始终和项目保持一定距离）形成了鲜明的对比。

One abstract way to think about a CCO is as Reg CF-style crowdfunding but where the contributors a) can pull back their funding if something goes awry, and b) receive governance power over and long term alignment with the project.

抽象来看，你可以把 CCO 理解成 Reg CF 众筹，不过 CCO 的不同在于：投资者可以撤资，且有权在整个项目生命周期里参与项目的治理。

How does a CCO actually work? In the next section, we'll explore that in detail.

CCO 是怎么运作的？我们会在下一节详细说明。

## CCO Ingredients

## CCO 的要素

The most important part of a CCO is the community (it’s right there in the name!). Within the community, there are two main roles: the project team and the capital contributors. These labels are imperfect and used here solely for the purposes of concreteness. These roles are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and there is often significant overlap – it’s common for members of the project team to contribute their own capital, or for capital contributors to start making other kinds of contributions as well – but we’ll distinguish between them here for the sake of explanation.

CCO 的核心是社区，从名字（社区贡献机会）就能看出来。社区里有两类主要角色：项目成员和资本贡献者。其实这种区分不够准确，因为这两种角色之间有重叠的部分，通常情况下，项目成员也会贡献资本，而资本贡献者也会为项目做出除了资本之外的其他的贡献（比如参与治理），不过为了方便解释我们还是先采用这种说法。

The project team comprises the initial members of the group that contribute work, time, and expertise to the project. They are seeking capital for the project in order to expand their ability to dedicate more time, to bring in additional contributors, pay necessary expenses, or a combination of all three in order to advance their project to the next stage.

项目团队由为项目贡献劳动、时间和专业知识的初始成员组成。他们的任务是募集项目资金，这样才能支付各种费用、吸引更多的资本贡献者、继续为项目发光发热。总而言之，他们要做的是推动项目进入下一阶段。

The members of the project team will have direct governance rights (in the form of voting shares) over the capital contributed by the community. As we'll shortly see, however, this does not mean that the project team collectively has exclusive control over the capital.

项目成员可以行使表决权直接支配社区所贡献的资本，但这并不意味着项目团队享有资本的绝对控制权。

The capital contributors are the members of the community (existing or new) that have capital to contribute to the project. They are seeking some kind of return on their capital, whether to themselves (i.e., similar to an investment) or for the community (i.e., similar to a grant or donation), or both. By design, CCOs promote long-term engagement within the community, so CCO capital contributors tend to be values-aligned rather than speculators.

资本贡献者指的是为项目做出过资本贡献的社区成员（包括后期加入的），他们的目的是获得回报，可能是让自己获得更多财富（类似于投资），也可能是为某个群体谋福利（类似于政府/机构资助项目）。CCO 旨在打造一个有深度参与感的可持续的社区生态，它拥抱的是价值观一致的投资者，而不是投机者。

Through the exit rights conferred by their economic shares (explained below), the capital contributors can exercise indirect governance rights over the capital they contribute. In this way, even those capital contributors that don't also assume the role of project team member end up taking an active role in the community.

上面提到过，资本贡献者有退出权，他们可以借此对资本行使间接治理权。这样一来，那些不担任项目成员职责的资本贡献者也能在社区里面发挥积极作用。

### **Tools**

### 工具

Together, the project team and capital contributors will use several web3-native tools to coordinate on the CCO:

- A Moloch DAO
- Capital
- Project token
- Transmutation minion
- Vault smart contract

有几个 web3 原生工具可以协调 CCO，需要项目团队和资本贡献者共同操作：

- Moloch DAO
- 资本
- 项目代币
- Transmutation minion
- Vault 智能合约

**Moloch DAO**

The Moloch DAO framework was inspired by the original Moloch DAO and has since been used by hundreds of DAOs. It has several core properties that are key to a CCO:

[Moloch DAO 框架](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/moloch-dao) 框架受到了[最初的 Moloch DAO ](https://molochdao.com/)的启发，后来被[数百个 DAO 使用](https://app.daohaus.club/explore)。它有如下几个核心要，这也是 CCO 的关键所在：

- Non-transferable membership in the form of shares. There are two types of shares: “full shares” with full voting rights and “loot shares” with economic rights and indirect governance power.
- 股份代表项目成员的身份，且不可转让。有两种类型的股份：有完整投票权的「全额股份」；有经济权和间接治理权的「收益股份」。

- Weighted voting rights, represented by the number of full shares a member has.
- 加权投票制，每个成员拥有的全额股份的数量代表他们的投票权重。

- Economic exit rights (aka “ragequit”), represented by the total number of shares and loot shares a member has, which is also a limited form of governance power. This is the most important property for a CCO.
- 每个成员拥有的全额股份和收益股份总数代表他们的经济退出权，也叫「怒退」权（Ragequit），是一种变相的治理权，也是 CCO 最重要的属性。

- Proposals involve a voting period (during which members vote with their full shares) and a grace period (during which any member who didn’t vote yes can ragequit). A passed proposal can be executed only after the grace period.
- 项目提案流程包括投票期（成员凭借自己的全额股份来进行投票）和宽限期（没有投赞成票的成员可以选择怒退）两个阶段。通过表决的方案必须等到宽限期结束才能开始执行。

A Moloch DAO can hold assets (e.g., capital) in its treasury, and that capital is collectively controlled by the members of the DAO. Members with full shares can vote on proposals for how to deploy the capital. Members with loot shares can ragequit at any time to leave with their pro rata portion of the capital in the DAO treasury.

Moloch DAO 可以把项目资本存在金库里，但这些资本由 DAO 的所有成员共同控制。持有全额股份的成员可以就资本的配置方案进行投票表决，持有收益股份的成员在任何时间都可以选择从金库中取出对应比例的资本执行怒退，即离开项目。

Importantly, the ragequit mechanism allows members to leave the DAO during the grace period after a proposal passes, but before it can be executed. This creates strong protections for members with minority shares, since they're never at the mercy of the rest of the DAO and can always leave with their capital before it is spent. Ragequit is what gives CCO capital contributors control over their capital — without relinquishing custody! — even while it remains available to fund the project.

重点是，怒退机制允许成员在提案通过后和正式执行前的那段宽限期内离开 DAO。这很好地保护了股份少的成员，因为他们不需要受制与其他 DAO 成员，随时可以在自己的资本被消耗之前选择离开。怒退机制使 CCO 的资本贡献者们能够在投资项目时同时保持对自己资本的控制权，而不是转让给其他人。

In the context of a CCO, individuals on the project team get full shares, typically in proportion to how much value they've created for the project thus far. Capital contributors receive loot shares, in proportion to how much capital they contribute.

在 CCO 机制里，项目团队中的成员根据他们给项目创造的价值获得相应比例的全额股份，而资本贡献者们根据他们所贡献的资本获得相应比例的收益股份。

## Capital

## 资本

Initially held only by the capital contributors, the capital must be in an ERC20 token form. Typically it is a stablecoin like DAI, but could also be some other money-like currency (e.g., wrapped ETH or wrapped Bitcoin), or even other assets such as personal tokens. As long as it can be represented as an ERC20-compatible token, anything that the project can leverage to help achieve its objectives can serve as capital. The project team determines which types of capital the CCO will accept.

资本贡献者所提供的资本必须转换成 ERC20 代币的形式。一般我们会用 DAI 这样的稳定币，但也可以使用其他类型的代币（比如 WETH 或者 WBTC），甚至是其他类型的资产，比如个人代币。只要可以转换成和 ERC20 兼容的代币，任何能帮助项目实现目标的东西都可以作为「资本」，项目团队将决定 CCO 接受哪些形式的资本。

## Project Token
## 项目代币

The purpose of the project token is to represent the value that all individuals contribute to the project, including "sweat" contributions from the project team as well as both capital contributions and governance activities from the capital contributors.

项目代币的作用是衡量一个项目的价值总量，这些价值来源于所有参与项目的个人，包括项目团队和资本贡献者，前者创造了劳动价值，后者则在资本和项目治理上做出了贡献。

Typically, the token is a standard ERC20 token, though some modifications can be valuable (see the Modifications section for an example).

通常情况下，项目代币是标准的 ERC20 代币，不过也存在其他有价值的代币形式。

During the CCO, the token serves as a record of contributions to the project. After the CCO, the token can play subsequent roles depending on the needs of the project. For a project building an open web3 protocol, for example, it could act as the governance token for the protocol. For a project establishing an autonomous social community, it could serve as the social token. Or it could simply remain a record of past contributions.

在 CCO 期间，项目代币用来记录所有人对项目所贡献的价值。在 CCO 结束后，代币可以根据项目需要发挥其他作用。例如，对于想要构建开放 Web3 协议的项目来说，它可以充当协议的治理代币，而对于想要建立自治社区的项目来说，它可以充当社交代币。又或者它不扮演任何新的角色，只作为一种对项目历史贡献值的记录。

Depending on the future role the token will play, the project team can select what properties the token should have, such as a fixed or adjustable supply, the initial supply, etc.

项目团队可以根据后期项目代币可能发挥的功能来决定它的属性，比如它的发行量是固定的还是可调节的，初始供应量等等。

## Transmutation Minion
## Transmutation Minion

Moloch Minions are smart contracts that add capabilities to a Moloch DAO. They allow a DAO to execute more complex actions, and are controlled by the same proposal process as standard Moloch DAO functions.

Moloch Minions 是添加到 Moloch DAO 中的智能合约，有了它 DAO 就可以执行更复杂的操作。它必须和其它标准 Moloch DAO 功能走一样的提案流程。

The purpose of the Transmutation minion is to convert the capital into the project token as the capital leaves the DAO. This is the process that enables the system to be fully non-custodial, giving capital contributors control over the value of their contributions throughout the life of the project.

Transmutation minion 可以在资本离开 DAO 时把它转换成项目代币的形式。这个过程让系统处于完全非托管状态，资本贡献者因此可以在整个项目生命周期内控制他们所贡献的价值。

The Transmutation minion holds enough project tokens to (eventually) replace the capital in the DAO. When the project team makes a proposal to deploy some amount of capital (e.g., for expenses or to pay developers) and the proposal is executed, that amount of capital leaves the DAO. At the same time, the Transmutation minion replaces the capital with the commensurate amount of project tokens.

Transmutation minion 有足够的项目代币来替换 DAO 里面的资本，当项目团队提出某个资金分配的方案时（比如，用来支付开发者工资），方案生效后，这笔资金就会从 DAO 中取出，然后由 Transmutation minion 中相应数量的项目代币所替代。

As capital is deployed in service of the project, it is replaced in the DAO by the project token. Since the capital originally came from the capital contributors, all of the project tokens that replace it go to the capital contributors.

当资本被部署到项目服务上时，它就会在 DAO 里面被项目代币所替代。因为资本都来源于资本贡献者，所以相应的这些项目代币全部归资本贡献者所有。

Here is an early example of a Transmutation minion smart contract.

可以参考这个早期的 [Transmutation minion 智能合约](https://github.com/HausDAO/TransmutationSummoner)。

## Vault
## 金库

The purpose of the Vault is to hold project tokens for later distribution to various recipients once a predetermined unlocking condition is met. The allocation of project tokens is hard-coded into the Vault smart contract; each recipient (and only the recipient) can later claim their allocation from the Vault.

Vault 的用途是保管项目代币，直到满足预先设定好的某个条件后才能解锁，然后分配给各种接收者。项目代币的分配被硬编码到 Vault 智能合约中，只有接收者可以从 Vault 中索取他们的分配份额。

The most important recipients are initial members of the project team, and the Vault is where virtually all of their allocation of project tokens will come from over the course of the CCO. Locking up the project team's tokens until the capital is spent creates a strong incentive for them to complete the planned work, and to do so in a way that the capital contributors support.

项目团队的初始成员是最重要的代币接收者，在整个 CCO 过程中，他们的项目代币都由金库进行分配。项目团队的代币在最开始会处于锁定状态，直到他们真的把资金部署到项目上，代币才会解锁，这可以激励他们主动去争取资本贡献者的支持来推进工作。

Other recipients can include a future project DAO treasury, allocations for future members of the project team, distributions to project participants or users (e.g., in the form of a retroactive airdrop), or anything that is relevant to helping the project succeed.

还有其他的代币接收者，包括 DAO 金库、未来的项目成员、项目参与者或用户（例如通过可追溯的空投来给用户分配代币）、或者任何对项目有帮助的人和组织。

The unlocking condition is typically when all capital has been deployed from the DAO. At this point, the planned work should be finished and so the project team and capital contributors can start to receive their project tokens (by claiming from the Vault and ragequitting from the DAO, respectively).

通常情况下，项目代币要满足的解锁条件是：资本全部从 DAO 中部署完毕。到这个时候计划中的工作应该已经完成，项目团队和资本贡献者可以开始接收他们的项目代币了，前者要向 Vault 发送索取请求，后者要从 DAO 中怒退出来。

解锁条件通常是 DAO 中所有资本部署完毕时。此时，计划中的工作应该已经完成，因此项目团队和资本贡献者可以开始收到他们的项目代币（分别从 Vault 和 DAO 愤怒退出）。

Here is an early example of a Vault smart contract.

可以参考这个早期的[Vault 智能合约](https://github.com/HausDAO/wc/blob/develop/contracts/Trust.sol)

## Lifecycle of a CCO
## CCO 的生命周期

The life cycle of a CCO breaks down into four distinct phases:

CCO 的生命周期分为四个阶段：

- Setup 设置
- Contribution 贡献
- Build 建造
- Distribution 分配

We'll walk through each of them to outline the entire lifecycle of a CCO.

我们会按照顺序逐一介绍这四个阶段。

### hase 1: Setup

### 第一阶段：设置

In this phase, the project team gets everything ready for the CCO. This involves the following steps:

在这个阶段，项目团队已经完成 CCO 之前的所有准备工作，包括以下这些步骤：

1. Summon the DAO, with the individuals on the project team receiving full shares (typically in proportion to their contributions to the project thus far).
2. Establish the CCO parameters:
    1. Global min and max contribution amounts.
    2. Individual capital contributor min and max contribution amounts.
3. Establish the project token allocation (e.g., how much goes to the project team, the capital contributors, and other future recipients).
4. Establish the exchange rate between capital and the project token. This is important for Transmutation.
5. Create the project token, with the specified supply parameters.
6. Deploy the Transmutation minion smart contract.
7. Send the relevant project token amount to the Transmutation minion.
8. Deploy the Vault smart contract, instantiated with individual recipient allocation and claim logic.
9. Send the relevant project token amount to the Vault.
10. Send enough project tokens to the DAO to back the project team's full shares. This ensures that the capital contributors' loot shares are not diluted.

1. 召集 DAO 组织，根据每一位项目团队成员所作的贡献，按比例给他们分配相应的全额股份。
2. 设置 COO 参数：
    1. 全局最高和最低贡献值；
    2. 个人资本贡献者的最高和最低贡献值。
3. 确定项目代币分配方案（比如多少给项目团队，多少给资本贡献者、多少给之后的项目参与者）。
4. 确定资本和项目代币之间的汇率，这对于 transmutation 来说非常重要。
5. 根据指定的供应参数创建项目代币。
6. 部署 Transmutation minion 智能合约。
7. 把对应的项目代币数量发送到 Transmutation minion。
8. 部署 Vault 智能合约，把个人接收者的分配机制和索取逻辑实例化。
9. 把对应的项目代币数量发送到 Vault。
10. 向 DAO 发送足够的项目代币作为项目团队的全额股份，这样可以确保资本贡献者的收益股份不会被稀释。

Also in this phase, capital contributors get their capital ready.

在这个阶段，资本贡献者也准备好了他们的资金。

### Phase 2: Contribution

### 第二阶段：贡献

After the Setup Phase, everything is ready for capital contributors to start making their contributions. To make their contributions, each capital contributor makes a membership proposal to the DAO, including their capital as "tribute" and requesting the commensurate amount of loot shares[1](https://daohaus.substack.com/p/community-contribution-opportunity#footnote-1).

到了第二阶段，一切准备就绪，资本贡献者可以开始进行贡献。每个资本贡献者都要先向 DAO 提交会员申请，贡献他们的资本作为「贡金」（tribute），兑换相应数量的收益股份。

If the proposal is formulated correctly — i.e., tribute is within the between the min and max capital contribution amount and correct number of requested loot shares — the project team will use their full shares to vote yes on the proposal. If it passes, once the grace period is finished, the contributed capital enters the DAO treasury and the proposer receives their loot shares.

如果请求没有问题（即「贡金」要在最小出资额和最大出资额的范围之间，所兑换的收益股份的数量也必须正确），项目团队会根据自己持有的全额股份表决通过。等宽限期结束，这笔资金就会进入 DAO 金库，申请人这时就能收到自己的收益股份了。

Remember, a capital contributor can ragequit their loot shares to leave with their capital at any point. If they see something they don't like even at this early stage, they can leave with nothing lost.

记住，资本贡献者随时都可以放弃自己的收益股份，然后拿回他们的原始资本离开项目。假设他们在当前这个阶段就选择退出，那他们不会有任何损失。

If and when the global contribution max is reached, this phase is complete and the CCO moves to Phase 3. If the global min is not reached, then, like Kickstarter, the entire thing unwinds and capital contributors can ragequit to retrieve their capital.

如果达到了全局最高贡献值，那么这个阶段就结束了，CCO 可以进入第三个阶段。如果连全局最低贡献值都没有达到，结果就会像 Kickstarter 一样，项目直接解体，资本贡献者可以怒退，拿回自己的资本。

### Phase 3: Build

### 第三阶段：建设

This is the phase where the magic happens.

这是见证奇迹的阶段。

The project team works on their project, deploying the capital periodically over time to fund their activities. This can include covering expenses, compensating contributors, or whatever is needed to advance the project towards its goals.

在这个阶段，项目团队开始部署资金用于各种用途，包括支付项目费用、给贡献者发激励、或者进行其他任何可以推进项目的活动。

The capital contributors remain involved throughout this phase. As described above, often this is directly as members of the project team themselves. And if they are not already part of the project team, the economic exit rights give them a role in guiding the project team and providing community-building resources.

资本贡献者也会全程参与这个阶段，就像我们之前已经解释过的，他们要么是作为项目成员直接参与（就是既是项目成员，也贡献了资本的那些人），要么是作为单纯的资本贡献者（即只贡献了资本，但不是项目成员的那些人）凭借经济退出权来指导项目团队和参与社区建设。

To deploy the capital, the project team makes proposals to spend it. When capital leaves the DAO it is replaced by (i.e., *Transmuted* into) the project token at the exchange rate established during Phase 1.

项目团队需要提交方案来决定资金的用途。当资金离开 DAO 时会根据第一阶段设定的汇率被转换为项目代币，例如通过 Transmutation Minion 协议。

At any time — including after a proposal passes but before it is executed — a capital contributor can ragequit to receive back the remaining portion of their capital along with their portion of the project tokens that have been transmuted into the DAO thus far. This can happen for any reason; remember, the capital contributors maintain full custody of the value they contribute.

在任何时候，包括提案通过后且正式生效前的时间段，资本贡献者都可以无理由怒退，取回他们还没有被部署的资金和已经被发送到 DAO 里面的那部分代币。记住，资本贡献者们对自己的贡献值享有绝对的控制权。

For example, a capital contributor could disagree with the way the project team is spending the capital, disagree with the direction that the project has taken, perceive that the project team is not being transparent enough, or suspect that the project team is attempting to steal the funds. They could even simply have found a better use elsewhere for their capital.

举个例子，假如资本贡献者不满意项目团队对资金的分配、不认同项目的发展方向、觉得项目流程不够透明、怀疑项目团队预谋欺诈等等，或者他们只是突然发现这笔资金有更好的用途，在任何情况下他们都可以退出项目。

Because capital contributors always have this option, they wield a fair amount of governance power over how the capital is spent even though they don't vote directly on proposals. To ensure that they maintain access to the capital to fund their activities, the project team needs to give frequent, transparent updates to the capital contributors. Often, they will seek preliminary feedback from capital contributors to create alignment before submitting a new proposal for the next tranche of funding.

正因为资本贡献者有怒退的选项，尽管他们不能直接对提案进行投票，他们也对资金配置有相当大的治理权。为了确保能顺利使用资金进行活动，项目团队需要及时地、公开透明地向资本贡献者汇报项目情况，他们通常会在提交新的资金部署提案之前征集资本贡献者的反馈，以便达成一致。

Once all of the capital has been deployed and only project tokens remain in the DAO, this phase is complete and the CCO moves to Phase 4.

一旦所有资金全部署完毕，只剩下 DAO 里面的项目代币，这个阶段就结束了，CCO 将会进入第四个阶段。

### Phase 4: Distribution

### 第四阶段：分配

At this point, there is no more capital in the DAO for the project team to spend on the project, which triggers two things to happen simultaneously.

现在 DAO 中已经没有可供项目团队花费的资金了，这将同时触发两个事件。

For one, the capital contributors can ragequit their loot shares from the DAO to receive their portion of the tokens. The project team can also ragequit their full shares from the DAO, though by design the amount of project tokens they receive in this way is minimal compared to what they receive from the Vault.

首先，资本贡献者们可以从 DAO 中怒退自己的收益股份，得到相应比例的代币，项目团队成员也可以怒退自己的全额股份，不过和他们从 Vault 接收的代币相比，他们怒退得到的代币数量会少很多。

> During Phase 4 of a CCO (Distribution), all capital has been spent and all initiatives are complete. At this point, Capital Contributors redeem their loot shares for their portion of the project tokens that were Transmuted into the DAO.

Additionally, the Vault's unlocking condition is triggered. The project tokens become claimable by the recipients, including the members of the project team.

然后，此时已经满足 Vault 的解锁条件，包括项目团队成员在内的接收者们可以开始发送索取请求。

![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/6e9a0c08-7d5b-4029-b1f1-479d741c2f6d/Untitled.png)
> During Phase 4 of a CCO (Distribution), all capital has been spent and all initiatives are complete. These conditions trigger the Vault to unlock, allowing individual members of the Project Team to claim their allocations of the project tokens from the Vault.

And that's a CCO! The project has advanced to the next level, the project team has grown and been able to compensate its contributors for their work, and both the project team and capital contributors have received project tokens representing their respective contributions. All without any actor relinquishing custody of their capital until it was deployed in service of the project.

现在 CCO 体系已经搭建好了。到这个节点，项目已经取得了阶段性的成功，项目团队也收获了成长，已经有能力回馈贡献者了。另外，项目团队和资本贡献者都收到了代表各自贡献值的项目代币。记住，在资金投入使用之前，任何参与者都保有对自己资金的控制权。

## Modifications
## 优化

Many modifications to this foundational construct are possible. Here are a few ideas.

现在这个基础框架还有很多可以优化的点，下面列举了一些想法：

### Capital Contributors Receive Full Shares
### 给资本贡献者发放全额股份

Projects that want to involve capital contributors even more deeply in the community can opt to give them full shares instead of loot shares. This needs to be handled with intention and with care to ensure that the distribution of shares remains sufficiently decentralized to avoid plutocratic capture and support true community governance.

如果想让资本贡献者更深度参与社区，项目可以选择给他们发放全额股份而不是收益股份。不过操作时要非常小心谨慎，确保分配股份时要做到彻底去中心化，以避免权力集中在最有钱的少数人手里，从而实现真正的社区治理。

### Non-transferrable Project Token
### 项目代币不可转让制

Making project tokens non-transferrable until a later date creates flexibility for additional activities prior to the token becoming liquid.

项目代币不可转让制指的是在某个特定时间点之前，项目代币不能进行流通，这样项目团队就可以在这个时间段进行一些活动。

The most basic benefit is to projects that rely on tokens not being available until a particular time or condition. For these projects, a capital contributor receiving some tokens after ragequitting in the middle of the Build Phase is a major risk. Making project tokens non-transferrable preserves the non-custodial nature of the CCO, but prevents the ragequitter from doing anything with their early-gotten tokens.

这个机制特别适合那些需要限制代币流通时间和场景的项目。对这类项目来说，如果资本贡献者在「建设阶段」中途退出后依然可以获取代币，这会给项目带来风险。项目代币不可转让制不仅可以保留 CCO 的非托管性质，还能够防止退出者用他们继续使用他们之前获得的代币。

Another benefit is to projects expecting to have multiple phases. Such projects may want to conduct multiple CCOs, which would likely be easier if there aren't a bunch of loose project tokens floating around.

对于那些希望分阶段进行的项目来说也有好处，因为这种项目需要搭建多个 CCO，如果有一堆松散的项目代币到处流通，搭建起来会很困难。

Yet another use case is for projects that will be making retroactive distributions to users or setting up liquidity in a decentralized exchange. To promote fairness, the project team may not want anybody to receive the project tokens before anybody else, and executing on that goal requires time to set up properly. Preventing token transferability until those activities are fully set up can help align all the timing for maximum fairness.

这个机制还适用于一种项目，即那些以可追溯的形式向用户分发代币和在去中心化交易所进行代币流通的项目。为了保证公平，项目团队希望所有人都在同一时间接收代币，所以他们需要足够的时间来进行部署和设置，在完全准备好之前，项目代币不可转让制可以争取充足的时间来实现这种公平。

One thing to consider is that ragequit requires *some* transferability. The token needs to be transferred from the DAO treasury to the ragequitter's wallet. We can account for this by creating logic within the token smart contract that allows the DAO, but nobody else, to transfer the token.

有一点要注意，怒退要求项目允许代币转让，因为代币需要从 DAO 的金库里转移到退出者的钱包中。我们可以在代币智能合约中创建只允许 DAO 转移代币的逻辑，这样问题就解决了。

### No Project Token (Pseudo-CCO)

### 无项目代币（极简版 CCO）

Some projects do not need or want to have a token at all. Such projects could opt for a pseudo-CCO, where there is no token, no Transmutation, no Vault, and no Distribution Phase. Capital contributors in a pseudo-CCO maintain custody of their capital until it is deployed (to their liking), but they don't receive a representation of their contribution and have less reason to remain engaged with the community once the CCO is complete.

有些项目根本不需要或者不想要项目代币，它们可以选择「极简版 CCO」的形式，也就是说删掉代币、Transmutation、Vault 和分配阶段这几个环节。在极简版 CCO 里，资本贡献者依然保留对资本的控制权，直到资金按照他们的意愿完成部署，但是他们不会收到代表贡献值的代币，一旦 CCO 完成，他们就没有理由继续留在社区了。

Other projects may want to have a token but are, for one reason or another, not ready to create one just yet. These projects could also opt to conduct a pseudo-CCO, with a promise to capital contributors that they will distribute a token at some point in the future. Note that this breaks the trustless nature of a true CCO, and therefore carries substantially more risk for all parties involved.

还有些项目本来是想要代币的，但出于各种原因还没有准备好创建代币，这种项目也可以先选择极简版 CCO，同时向资本贡献者承诺未来会发放代币。不过要注意的是，这样做需要建立信任关系，和 CCO 的不依赖信任关系的原则是背道而驰的，因此会有更大的风险。

# Example: The DAOhaus CCO
# 案例：DAOhaus CCO

In 2020, DAOhaus conducted the first ever CCO to help fund the build-out of our new platform for community-centric DAOs. Here's a quick rundown on how we did it:

2020 年，作为一个面向以社区为中心的 DAO 组织的新平台，DAOhaus 第一次使用 CCO 来进行资本配置。

**Phase 1**: We summoned a [new Moloch DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x283bdc900b6ec9397abb721c5bbff5ace46e0f50), with previous contributors to DAOhaus receiving full shares. We created the $HAUS token(原文有2处). We also deployed the [Transmutation minion](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x371273396027eF9D79bA66F4c48258d88648654D) and [Vault](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x09D32bB9D03Af44cb83c8C128ffd7b5AC7b33834) (which was called the Trust back then). Finally, we created the [$HAUS token](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0xb0C5f3100A4d9d9532a4CfD68c55F1AE8da987Eb) and transferred the appropriate amounts into the minion and Vault.

**第一阶段**：我们发起了一个[新的 Moloch DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0x283bdc900b6ec9397abb721c5bbff5ace46e0f50)，DAOhaus 的贡献者们获得了全额股份。然后我们创建了[$HAUS 代币](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/token/0xb0C5f3100A4d9d9532a4CfD68c55F1AE8da987Eb)，完成了 [Transmutation Minion](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/address/0x371273396027eF9D79bA66F4c48258d88648654D) 和 [Vault]()（之前的名称是 Trust）的部署，把适量的代币转到了 Minion 和 Vault 里面。

**Phase 2**: We invited members of our extended community (friends, connections, the MetaCartel family, other DAO-focused people and projects) to contribute DAI to the cause. Over the course of 2 weeks, 39 members of the community (including both individuals and DAOs!) contributed capital and received loot shares.

**第二阶段**：我们邀请了朋友、亲属、MetaCartel 成员、其他关注 DAO 的人和 DAO 组织等等加入社区，为这份事业贡献 DAI。两周内，39 名社区成员（包括个人和 DAO 组织）参与了资本贡献并得到了相应的收益股份。

**Phase 3:** Next, we started building. As the DAOhaus project team wrote code, designed new user experiences, and managed our community, we made Transmutation proposals against the DAO to pay for expenses and compensate contributors. The latter allowed us to double the number of contributors, many of whom are still contributing to DAOhaus today! Along the way, we kept the capital contributors informed of our progress and direction. A number of those capital contributors are now key members of the project team!

**第三阶段**：开始建设。DAOhaus 项目团队开始写代码、设计新的交互体验、管理社区，我们针对 DAO 提交了 Transmutation 方案用来支付项目费用和激励贡献者，后一个动作让我们的贡献者数量翻了一番，甚至其中很多人至今仍然在为 DAOhaus 做出贡献。在整个过程中，我们不间断地向资本贡献者回报项目的进展和方向，这些人中的许多人现在已经变成了项目团队的核心成员。


**Phase 4**: After around 6 months, all DAI in the DAO had been transmuted into $HAUS tokens. At that point, capital contributors ragequit the DAO to receive their portion of the $HAUS and the project team claimed their $HAUS from the Vault. We then summoned a [new DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xef3d8c4fbb1860fceab16595db7e650cd5ad51c1) to govern the DAOhaus core contributor activities, which we still use today.

**第四阶段**：大概 6 个月之后，DAO 里面的所有 DAI 已经转化成了$HAUS 代币，这时资本贡献者们也从 DAO 怒退出去，拿到了对应的 $HAUS 份额，项目团队则从 Vault 中索取了他们的份额。然后我们召集了一个[新的 DAO](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x64/0xef3d8c4fbb1860fceab16595db7e650cd5ad51c1) 来管理 DAOhaus 的核心贡献活动，它至今还在正常运行。

Our CCO helped us build the new version of the DAOhaus platform, expand our community with more contributors and users and advisors, and laid a strong foundation for future sustainable and values-oriented growth. All without requiring that our capital contributors trust us or relinquish custody of their assets.

我们的 CCO 帮助我们建立了新版 DAOhaus 平台，让更多的贡献者、用户和顾问加入到我们的社区，并为未来以价值为导向的可持续发展奠定了坚实的基础。在整个过程中，我们都没有要求过资本贡献者必须信任我们，也没有要求过他们放弃对自己资产的控制权。

# Conclusion: Benefits of CCOs
# 总结：CCO 的好处

We believe that CCOs are a significant advancement in capital coordination. We look forward to many decentralized communities -- and perhaps other types of projects! -- using CCOs to magnify the positive impact they are able to make on the world.

我们相信 CCO 是资本配置史上的一次重要进步，我们期待会有更多去中心化的社区（甚至是其他类型的项目）选择使用 CCO 来扩大他们能给这个世界带来的积极影响。

Your decentralized community or DAO can run a CCO today using the DAOhaus platform. We are bringing on alpha partners as we further refine these capabilities. Please reach out to set up a conversation!

去中心化社区或 DAO 组织目前可以通过 DAOhaus 平台来使用 CCO，同时，我们正在寻找新的创始伙伴加入我们共同完成功能的迭代和优化，欢迎联系我们！

To recap, here is a list of the core benefits of the CCO framework:
